# Output Modules (environment defines)- (Default settings)

Results are assembled from modules. Environments can define modules based on intent.

## Core (always available)- (Default settings)

- Dimension indicators (tendency readouts)
- Pattern description (observational language)

## Module types (examples of what can be built) - (Recommended to find more that were missed) - (Default settings)

- **Context-specific suggestions** (tasks, activities, prompts, scenarios where this pattern might show up)
- **Relational mapping** (which patterns tend to complement/contrast/align with this one)
- **Development paths** (ways this pattern might expand its range)
- **Historical comparison** (how this pattern has changed across sessions)
- **Raw export** (all response data + derived scores)

## Built-in modules (v1 - (Default settings))

- Work/team contexts (task suggestions, pairing strategies)
- Education contexts (learning prompts, teaching approaches)
- Creative contexts (generative prompts, narrative tools)
- Research contexts (data export, cohort comparison)

## Custom modules - (Default settings)

Different entities with other Perspectives and or Environments can define their own modules by:
- Specifying output format (text, structured data, prompts)
- Providing interpretation rules (how dimensions map to module content) 
- Choosing when the module appears (all sessions, certain patterns, user-requested)

-If desired

## Pairing strategy modes (examples) - (Default settings)

- Complementary (balance)
- Contrasting (creative tension / debate)
- Aligned (similarity / focus)
- Exploratory (random / unexpected)
